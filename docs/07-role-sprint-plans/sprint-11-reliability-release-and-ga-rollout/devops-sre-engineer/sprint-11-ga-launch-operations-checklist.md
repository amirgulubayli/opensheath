# Sprint 11 GA Launch Operations Checklist (DevOps/SRE)

Sprint: 11 - Reliability, release, and GA rollout  
Gate: GA launch gate  
Story scope: `F8-E2-S1..S3`, `F8-E3-S1..S3`

## Week 1 Priorities

1. Finalize SLO dashboards and alert tuning for launch envelope.
2. Run load and capacity validation with production-like profiles.
3. Rehearse migration and rollback operations with timed sequence.

## Week 2 Priorities

1. Execute staged rollout controls and monitor stabilization metrics.
2. Validate incident response readiness for live ramp period.
3. Publish final GA decision evidence packet.

## One-Day Task Plan

| Task ID | Story | Task | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| S11-DV-01 | F8-E2-S1 | Final SLO signal tuning and burn-alert validation | SLO dashboard links |
| S11-DV-02 | F8-E2-S2 | Capacity and load test execution with comparison report | load test report |
| S11-DV-03 | F8-E3-S2 | Migration and rollback rehearsal validation | rehearsal notes |
| S11-DV-04 | F8-E3-S3 | Staged rollout monitoring and incident readiness checks | rollout logs |
| S11-DV-05 | Gate | Build GA launch evidence packet and sign-off summary | packet link set |

## Gate Evidence Required

1. SLO and reliability target evidence.
2. Load/capacity and bottleneck closure evidence.
3. Migration and rollback rehearsal proof.
4. Staged rollout stabilization and incident-readiness proof.
