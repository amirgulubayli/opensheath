# Sprint 07 AI Quality Operations Checklist (DevOps/SRE)

Sprint: 07 - Retrieval quality and AI safety  
Gate: AI quality gate  
Story scope: `F5-E2-S1..S3`, `F5-E3-S1..S3`, `F4-E3-S1..S3`

## Week 1 Priorities

1. Instrument retrieval latency/error budgets and relevance-quality signals.
2. Monitor citation and evidence-path failure rates.
3. Add model-version quality drift alerting.

## Week 2 Priorities

1. Validate moderation/safety signal monitoring.
2. Validate model rollback control telemetry and trigger criteria.
3. Publish AI quality gate evidence packet.

## One-Day Task Plan

| Task ID | Story | Task | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| S07-DV-01 | F5-E2-S2 | Build retrieval latency/error dashboard with thresholds | dashboard links |
| S07-DV-02 | F5-E3-S1/S2 | Add citation/evidence pipeline anomaly monitoring | anomaly report |
| S07-DV-03 | F4-E3-S1 | Add eval-run telemetry integration for release gating | eval telemetry links |
| S07-DV-04 | F4-E3-S3 | Validate model rollback trigger observability | rollback drill notes |
| S07-DV-05 | Gate | Build day-9 AI quality evidence packet | packet link set |

## Gate Evidence Required

1. Retrieval and citation reliability metrics.
2. Quality/eval signal dashboards.
3. Safety/moderation monitoring references.
4. Model rollback readiness proof.
