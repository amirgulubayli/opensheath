# Sprint 08 Automation Gate Operations Checklist (DevOps/SRE)

Sprint: 08 - Integrations and automation engine  
Gate: Automation gate  
Story scope: `F6-E1-S1..S3`, `F6-E2-S1..S3`

## Week 1 Priorities

1. Instrument connector health and webhook delivery reliability signals.
2. Configure event retry and dead-letter observability.
3. Define SLO alerting for automation run success and failure rates.

## Week 2 Priorities

1. Validate replay operations and idempotency-safe recovery paths.
2. Tune alert thresholds for provider instability scenarios.
3. Publish automation gate evidence packet.

## One-Day Task Plan

| Task ID | Story | Task | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| S08-DV-01 | F6-E1-S3 | Build connector health dashboard and alert routes | dashboard links |
| S08-DV-02 | F6-E2-S3 | Add retry/dead-letter operational signal panels | queue health links |
| S08-DV-03 | F6-E2-S1/S2 | Instrument automation run success/failure and latency | run metrics links |
| S08-DV-04 | F6-E2-S3 | Validate replay and recovery operations | replay validation notes |
| S08-DV-05 | Gate | Build day-9 automation evidence packet | packet link set |

## Gate Evidence Required
