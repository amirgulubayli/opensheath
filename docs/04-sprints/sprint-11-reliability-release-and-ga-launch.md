# Sprint 11: Reliability, Release, and GA Launch

## Sprint Goal

Validate operational readiness, execute staged rollout controls, and complete GA launch decision package.

## Epic Scope

- `F8-E2` Reliability and performance engineering.
- `F8-E3` Release and launch operations.

## In-Sprint Stories

- `F8-E2-S1`, `F8-E2-S2`, `F8-E2-S3`
- `F8-E3-S1`, `F8-E3-S2`, `F8-E3-S3`

## Engineering Execution Plan

### SRE/Platform Lane

- Tune SLO dashboards and alerting thresholds.
- Execute load/capacity tests and optimization pass.
- Validate runbook coverage and on-call readiness.

### Backend/Database Lane

- Rehearse migration and rollback in staging.
- Verify data integrity checks in cutover run.
- Close critical operational debt from prior sprints.

### Release Management Lane

- Run release quality gate checklist.
- Execute staged rollout plan (internal → beta cohort → broad GA).
- Track stabilization metrics and incident response readiness.

### QA/Security Lane

- Full critical flow regression run.
- Security final pass and unresolved risk sign-off.
- Validate rollback and kill-switch operations.

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1

- SLO and performance validation.
- Migration rehearsal and rollback drills.
- Release checklist validation.

### Week 2

- Controlled GA rollout execution.
- Live stabilization monitoring and rapid response.
- GA decision review and post-launch backlog capture.

## Exit Criteria

- Reliability targets achieved for launch envelope.
- Release controls and rollback operations validated.
- GA launch approved with risk acceptance documented.
