# Sprint 00: Inception and Architecture Lock

## Sprint Goal

Lock scope, architecture, risk posture, and execution model so implementation begins with minimal ambiguity.

## Sprint Objectives

1. Finalize feature hierarchy, epic boundaries, and story IDs.
2. Approve target architecture and integration strategy.
3. Establish governance controls and quality gates.
4. Create baseline risk and dependency register.

## Planned Deliverables

- Approved architecture blueprint and boundary rules.
- Documented DoR/DoD policy.
- Risk and dependency register with named owners.
- Sprint roadmap and initial staffing plan.

## Workstream Plan

### Product and Architecture

- Validate assumptions and required outcomes.
- Confirm MVP vs post-MVP scope split.
- Approve architecture decisions and sequencing.

### Platform and Delivery

- Define CI/CD policy and branch strategy.
- Define environment and secret management model.
- Define release gating workflow.

### Security and Operations

- Initial threat model draft.
- Security baseline requirements by feature.
- Incident severity and escalation matrix.

## Week-by-Week Execution

### Week 1

- Requirements lock workshop.
- Architecture review and decision consolidation.
- Backlog decomposition and dependency mapping.

### Week 2

- Governance document finalization.
- Sprint staffing and capacity planning.
- Sprint 01 kickoff readiness check.

## Exit Criteria

- Architecture gate approved.
- Story catalog complete for Sprints 01-03.
- All critical dependencies have owners and fallback plans.

## Risks to Monitor

- Unresolved domain ambiguity.
- Missing integration credentials setup timelines.
- Unowned security/compliance responsibilities.
