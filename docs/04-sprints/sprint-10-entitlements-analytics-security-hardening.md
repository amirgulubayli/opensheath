# Sprint 10: Usage Safeguards, Analytics, and Security Hardening

## Sprint Goal

Enforce non-monetized usage safeguards, instrument adoption analytics, and complete production security hardening for beta readiness.

## Epic Scope

- `F7-E2` Usage governance and safeguards.
- `F7-E3` Adoption analytics.
- `F8-E1` Security hardening.

## In-Sprint Stories

- `F7-E2-S1`, `F7-E2-S2`, `F7-E2-S3`
- `F7-E3-S1`, `F7-E3-S2`, `F7-E3-S3`
- `F8-E1-S1`, `F8-E1-S2`, `F8-E1-S3`

## Engineering Execution Plan

### Backend Usage Governance Lane

- Implement usage policy model and runtime enforcement.
- Implement usage metering and threshold governance.
- Implement recovery/reset states for limit edge cases.

### Data/Analytics Lane

- Instrument activation, adoption, and retention event taxonomy.
- Build baseline funnel and cohort dashboards.
- Validate event quality and schema integrity.

### Security Lane

- Perform threat model refresh and mitigation verification.
- Integrate dependency/secret scanning gates.
- Complete runtime hardening checks.

### QA/Release Lane

- Usage safeguard boundary and quota tests.
- Security regression and negative attack-path tests.
- Beta readiness checklist dry run.

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1

- Usage policies and enforcement middleware.
- Analytics event instrumentation and pipeline checks.
- Threat model and vulnerability backlog closure plan.

### Week 2

- Usage-recovery UX and quota edge cases.
- Dashboard completion and analytics validation.
- Security hardening completion and beta gate evidence.

## Exit Criteria

- Usage safeguards enforced consistently.
- Adoption metrics visible and trustworthy.
- Security hardening controls pass release gate.
