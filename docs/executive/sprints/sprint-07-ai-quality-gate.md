# Sprint 07: AI Quality Gate (Executive Detail)

## Objective

Deliver AI retrieval quality, citations, and moderation safety with observability evidence.

## Current Status

Retrieval and moderation are implemented; quality evidence and UI validation remain incomplete.

## Remaining Work (Step-by-Step)

1. Validate retrieval quality and citation correctness with test fixtures.
2. Confirm moderation outcomes are enforced in AI execution across tool types.
3. Validate AI observability metrics and alert thresholds.
4. Implement UI displays for moderation-denied responses and citation confidence.
5. Capture AI quality gate evidence.

## Lane Tasks

- AI Runtime: finalize moderation and retrieval quality evidence.
- Data Platform: confirm retrieval/citation persistence correctness.
- Frontend: render citations and moderation-denied UX states.
- DevOps/SRE: confirm AI observability metrics and alert thresholds.

## Evidence Required

- Retrieval quality test output and citation correctness proof.
- Moderation enforcement logs and UI proof.
- Observability dashboards or alert threshold evidence.

## Risks

- Moderate/blocked states not displayed consistently in UI.

## Exit Criteria

- AI quality gate packet complete with evidence.
