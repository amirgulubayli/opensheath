# Sprint 04: Core Workflow Gate (Executive Detail)

## Objective

Deliver stable project and document workflows with activity timeline and AI tool wrappers.

## Current Status

Backend core workflows exist; AI tool wrappers are partial; frontend UI is incomplete.

## Remaining Work (Step-by-Step)

1. Complete UI screens for project create, list, transition, and detail.
2. Complete UI screens for document create and lifecycle transitions.
3. Implement activity timeline UI and ensure it reflects backend events.
4. Expand AI tool wrappers to cover all core workflow actions.
5. Add integration tests for core workflow paths and AI tool execution.

## Lane Tasks

- Backend: ensure all workflow endpoints are tenant-scoped and tested.
- Frontend: wire UI to project/document lifecycle APIs.
- AI Runtime: ensure tool wrapper coverage and execution tests.

## Evidence Required

- UI workflow screenshots or e2e tests.
- API integration test output for core workflows.
- AI tool execution logs proving workflow actions.

## Risks

- Missing UI coverage for transition and failure states.

## Exit Criteria

- Core workflow gate packet complete and validated.
