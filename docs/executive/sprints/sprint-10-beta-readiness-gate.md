# Sprint 10: Beta Readiness Gate (Executive Detail)

## Objective

Deliver analytics integrity, entitlement safeguards for non-monetized scope, and security hardening.

## Current Status

Analytics integrity backend exists; UI and security evidence are incomplete.

## Remaining Work (Step-by-Step)

1. Implement analytics integrity UI with anomaly visibility.
2. Implement entitlement and usage guard UI aligned to non-monetized scope.
3. Validate analytics event ingestion and anomaly retrieval end-to-end.
4. Perform security hardening review and capture evidence.
5. Assemble beta readiness gate packet.

## Lane Tasks

- Backend: finalize analytics and entitlement APIs and tests.
- Frontend: build analytics and entitlement UI with feature flag guards.
- Security/Compliance: complete hardening review and sign-off.
- DevOps/SRE: confirm monitoring and alerting readiness for beta.

## Evidence Required

- Analytics integrity tests and UI evidence.
- Security/compliance sign-off notes.
- Monitoring readiness evidence.

## Risks

- Security/compliance evidence not available in time.

## Exit Criteria

- Beta readiness gate packet complete.
