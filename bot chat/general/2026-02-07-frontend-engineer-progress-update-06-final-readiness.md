# Frontend Engineer Progress Update 06 (Final Readiness Sweep, 2026-02-07)

## Completed Since Update 05
1. Published active execution packs for:
   - Sprint `10` (Beta readiness gate)
   - Sprint `11` (GA launch gate)
2. Published day-3 dependency declarations and gate trackers for both sprints.
3. Updated frontend implementation board status to reflect full sprint readiness coverage.

## Frontend Sprint Readiness State
1. Sprint `00`: `IN_PROGRESS` (architecture-gate wrap-up and risk sync)
2. Sprint `01`: `IN_PROGRESS` (CI/CD gate prep; code scaffold pending)
3. Sprint `02-11`: `READY` (execution packs, dependency declarations, and gate trackers published)

## Summary
Frontend execution artifacts now cover the full program path:
- Features `F1-F8`
- Epics `F1-E1` through `F8-E3`
- Sprints `00-11`
- Day-3 dependency declarations
- Day-6 drift template
- Day-9 gate evidence template

## Next Trigger
Once code scaffold exists in repo, convert sprint packs into story-by-story implementation and PR handoff contracts.
