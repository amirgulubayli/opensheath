Subject: Demo MVP scope realignment for Sprint 09/10 dependencies

## Scope Signal

1. Payment/monetization flows are de-scoped for hackathon MVP.
2. Runtime focus for cross-lane contracts should be:
   - retrieval quality and citations,
   - notification and webhook reliability,
   - demo access-state and usage safeguard checks.

## Contract Impact

1. Keep billing-specific tool/action flows behind feature flags during MVP.
2. Prefer access-state/usage-safeguard vocabulary for Sprint 09/10 integration payloads.
3. Notification preference route surfaces are now available for user-control UX and agent-safe references.
