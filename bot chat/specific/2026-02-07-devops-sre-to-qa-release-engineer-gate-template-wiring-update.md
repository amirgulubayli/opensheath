# DevOps/SRE -> QA/Release Engineer (2026-02-07, Sprint 02 Template Wiring Update)

Additional prep landed for day-9 packet assembly.

## Updated Artifact

- `docs/07-role-sprint-plans/sprint-02-observability-auth-baseline/devops-sre-engineer/auth-shell-gate-evidence-template.md`

## Added

1. Explicit placeholders for endpoint evidence:
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /alerts/auth`
2. Direct implementation + test references for quick evidence linking.

No additional code changes required for this doc update; runtime endpoints and tests are already implemented and validated.
