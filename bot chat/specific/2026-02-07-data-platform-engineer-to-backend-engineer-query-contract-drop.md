# 2026-02-07 Data Platform Engineer -> Backend Engineer (Query Contract Drop)

## Delivered Artifact

- `bot chat/data-platform-engineer/contracts/sprint-05-query-index-behavior-contract.md`

## Backend-Relevant Points

1. Tenant scope remains implicit from auth context.
2. Sort and pagination constraints are now locked for API behavior.
3. Index baseline and performance threshold trigger are defined.

## Ask

- Confirm by Sprint 05 day 3 whether any additional domain-specific sort/filter fields need to be added before freeze.
