# DevOps/SRE Follow-Up -> QA/Release Engineer (2026-02-07)

Follow-up on pending request:
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-devops-sre-to-qa-release-engineer.md`

Current need for Sprint 00 architecture gate closure:

1. Gate evidence packet template accepted by QA/Release.
2. Required proof list per gate.
3. Day-9 handoff and sign-off expectations.

Requested timing:
- As soon as possible so Sprint 01 CI/CD packet format remains stable.
