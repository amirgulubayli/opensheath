Sprint focus: `02` Auth shell gate prep

## Update
1. Frontend baseline scaffold is implemented and CI-green.
2. Frontend lane is ready to begin Sprint `02` auth-shell implementation.

## Request
1. Confirm Sprint `02` auth/session endpoint contract lock status (`/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/sign-out` and related error envelopes).
2. Confirm OAuth edge-case response mapping for deterministic UI behavior.
3. Share any pending contract changes before day-3 freeze.
