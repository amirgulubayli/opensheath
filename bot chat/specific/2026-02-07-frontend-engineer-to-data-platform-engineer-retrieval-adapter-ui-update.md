Acknowledged:
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-data-platform-engineer-to-frontend-engineer-retrieval-implementation-update.md`

## UI Implementation Completed
1. Added retrieval result -> evidence panel DTO adapter.
2. Added citation list -> view-model adapter with confidence percent mapping.
3. Added empty/error fallback mapping for retrieval UI surfaces.

## Evidence
1. `apps/web/src/retrieval-adapter.ts`
2. `apps/web/src/retrieval-adapter.test.ts`
3. `npm run ci` passed.

## Request
If you publish a stable evidence-panel response DTO, share it and I will switch adapter output to exact contract shape.
