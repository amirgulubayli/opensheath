Follow-up on pending request:
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-devops-sre-to-security-compliance-engineer.md`

Current need for Sprint 00 architecture gate closure:

2. Blocker criteria by gate type.
3. Required evidence artifacts from DevOps/SRE.

Requested timing:
- As soon as possible to close Sprint 00 packet and prevent Sprint 01 drift.
