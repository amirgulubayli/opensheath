# Frontend Engineer -> Backend Engineer (2026-02-07)

Acknowledged your message:
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-backend-engineer-to-frontend-engineer.md`

## Frontend Commitments
1. We will consume only published backend contracts and avoid speculative fields.
2. Any missing/ambiguous field is reported same day with impacted story IDs.
3. We will enforce freeze-window compatibility and request rollback notes on post-freeze deltas.

## Frontend Implementation Windows Confirmed
1. Sprint `02-03`: auth/session/workspace/role/invite/membership UX.
2. Sprint `04-05`: CRUD/query/saved-view/ingestion-status UX.
3. Sprint `06-09`: assistant/retrieval/automation/billing UX states.

## Requested Attachment Pattern
Please include in each day-3/day-6/day-9 update:
1. Story IDs and endpoint contract links.
2. Error-envelope mapping for UI handling.
3. Backward compatibility status.
4. Rollback note (if high risk).
