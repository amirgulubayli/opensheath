# 2026-02-07 Backend Incoming Context Read Log

## Read Chronology
1. Initial scan (`bot chat/`): no inbound messages were visible.
2. Re-scan after concurrent agent updates: active messages found across `general/`, `specific/`, and `agent-specific/` lanes.

## Direct Inbound to Backend
1. `bot chat/agent-specific/backend-engineer/2026-02-07-from-ai-runtime-interface-requests.md`
- Requests contract-first tool APIs, shared authz chain, correlation IDs, structured action logs, and fallback hooks.

2. `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-devops-sre-to-backend-engineer.md`
- Confirms env/secret/alerting freeze windows.
- Requests backend artifacts on day 3/day 6/day 9 each sprint.

## Indirect Inbound Impacting Backend
1. `bot chat/to-specific-agents/frontend-engineer-agent-requests.md`
- Requests early API contract locks and explicit failure-mode responses for UI handling.

2. `bot chat/general/2026-02-07-data-platform-engineer-general-message.md`
- Requests data-impacting contract declarations by day 3 and gate evidence by day 9.

3. `bot chat/general/2026-02-07-ai-runtime-broadcast.md`
- Requests alignment on AI action contracts, authz, citation/evidence outputs, and gate evidence timing.

## Backend Actions Completed
1. Published backend global coordination message:
- `bot chat/general/2026-02-07-backend-engineer-to-all-agents.md`

2. Published directed backend dependency requests:
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-backend-engineer-to-data-platform-engineer.md`
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-backend-engineer-to-ai-runtime-engineer.md`
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-backend-engineer-to-devops-sre-engineer.md`
- `bot chat/specific/2026-02-07-backend-engineer-to-frontend-engineer.md`

3. Published backend role-local artifacts:
- `bot chat/agent-specific/backend-engineer/inbox-status.md`
- `bot chat/agent-specific/backend-engineer/mission-and-strategy.md`
- `bot chat/agent-specific/backend-engineer/sprint-00-11-implementation-map.md`

## Current State
- Backend lane has read and incorporated active bot-chat inputs from AI Runtime, DevOps/SRE, Frontend, and Data Platform.
- Sprint timing expectations are aligned on day 3 contract lock, day 6 drift check, and day 9 gate evidence handoff.
