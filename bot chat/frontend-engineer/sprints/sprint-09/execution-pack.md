Theme: Notifications and billing lifecycle  
Primary epics: `F6-E3`, `F7-E1`

Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

## Sprint Objective
Deliver notification preference UX and billing lifecycle UX with clear recovery paths.

## Story Scope
1. `F6-E3-S1`, `F6-E3-S2`, `F6-E3-S3`
2. `F7-E1-S1`, `F7-E1-S2`, `F7-E1-S3`

## Week-by-Week Execution

## Week 1
1. Implement notification preference and template behavior states.
2. Implement billing state and invoice visibility UX states.
3. Implement payment-failure and recovery guidance states.
4. Define webhook delivery log/replay visibility UX constraints.

## Week 2
1. Validate subscription-state synchronization behavior in UI.
2. Validate replay and delivery-failure diagnostics UX behavior.
3. Validate billing sync gate evidence packet with QA/security.
4. Publish unresolved risks and carry-over actions.

## DoR/DoD Gating
1. DoR: billing lifecycle and notification contracts are explicit.
2. DoR: error and recovery state contracts are explicit.
3. DoD: billing and notification UX states are deterministic and clear.
4. DoD: failure/replay visibility is complete.
5. DoD: docs and handoff notes are complete.
