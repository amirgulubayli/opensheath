# Sprint 00 Frontend Execution Pack

Sprint: `00`  
Theme: Inception and architecture lock  
Gate: Architecture gate  
Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

## Objective
Establish UI foundation contracts and execution controls so frontend delivery can start in Sprint `01` without architecture drift.

## Section Execution (`00` -> `06`)

## 00-governance
1. DoR/DoD reviewed against sprint scope: `DONE`
2. Frontend risks/dependencies identified: `IN_PROGRESS`
3. Architecture gate evidence list confirmed by day 3: `IN_PROGRESS`

## 01-architecture
1. Mapped frontend scope to `docs/01-architecture/system-architecture.md`: `DONE`
2. Drafted UI contract-first enforcement rules: `DONE`
3. Logged architecture delta triggers for freeze violations: `DONE`

## 02-features
1. Route skeleton and state-boundary strategy documented: `DONE`
2. Future sprint dependency windows mapped (`01-11`): `DONE`
3. Failure-path UX conventions baselined: `IN_PROGRESS`

## 03-backlog
1. One-day task decomposition for Sprint `00` and `01`: `IN_PROGRESS`
2. Dependency linkage to `docs/03-backlog/dependency-map.md`: `DONE`
3. Reviewer/evidence expectations pre-assigned: `IN_PROGRESS`

## 04-sprint-execution
1. Week 1 output: mission, plan, and dependency publications: `DONE`
2. Week 2 output: gate evidence draft and carry-over recommendations: `IN_PROGRESS`
3. Day 10 demo packet draft: `QUEUED`

## 05-engineering-playbooks
1. PR quality gate checklist integrated into execution templates: `DONE`
2. Testing/observability expectations added to sprint artifacts: `IN_PROGRESS`
3. Rollback-readiness note template created: `IN_PROGRESS`

## 06-ai-agent-execution
1. Context pack checklist embedded in sprint pack: `DONE`
2. Handoff contract usage path defined: `DONE`
3. AI-output verification checklist drafted: `IN_PROGRESS`

## Deliverables for Sprint 00
1. Frontend mission and operating rules.
2. Frontend feature/epic/sprint implementation board.
3. Day-3 dependency declarations and specific-agent asks.
4. Architecture gate evidence tracker and progress log.

## Open Risks
1. No application code repository exists yet; execution currently limited to planning/handoff implementation artifacts.
2. Contract drift risk if cross-role day-3 declarations are not maintained every sprint.
