# Sprint 04 Frontend Execution Pack

Sprint: `04`  
Theme: Core domain workflows v1  
Primary epics: `F3-E1`, `F3-E2`  
Gate: Core workflow gate  
Status: `READY`

## Sprint Objective
Deliver deterministic daily workflow UX for core domain records without AI dependency.

## Story Scope
1. `F3-E1-S1`, `F3-E1-S2`, `F3-E1-S3`
2. `F3-E2-S1`, `F3-E2-S2`, `F3-E2-S3`

## Week-by-Week Execution

## Week 1
1. Implement list/detail view contract states.
2. Implement create/edit/archive form contract and validation-state UX.
3. Implement optimistic-update and conflict feedback patterns.
4. Define timeline rendering contract for activity log events.

## Week 2
1. Validate lifecycle behavior against domain transition rules.
2. Validate archive/restore and conflict handling edge cases.
3. Validate core workflow gate evidence packet with QA.
4. Publish unresolved risks and carry-over actions.

## DoR/DoD Gating
1. DoR: domain validation and transition contracts are explicit.
2. DoR: activity timeline event contract is stable.
3. DoD: CRUD behaviors satisfy acceptance criteria and failure handling.
4. DoD: tests include conflict and archive negative-path scenarios.
5. DoD: docs and handoff notes are complete.
