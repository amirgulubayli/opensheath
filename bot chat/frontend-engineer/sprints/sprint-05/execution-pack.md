# Sprint 05 Frontend Execution Pack

Sprint: `05`  
Theme: Search and ingestion v1  
Primary epics: `F3-E3`, `F5-E1`  
Gate: Discoverability gate  
Status: `READY`

## Sprint Objective
Deliver discoverability and ingestion-facing UX so users can find records quickly and track uploaded document processing.

## Story Scope
1. `F3-E3-S1`, `F3-E3-S2`, `F3-E3-S3`
2. `F5-E1-S1`, `F5-E1-S2`, `F5-E1-S3`

## Week-by-Week Execution

## Week 1
1. Implement search/filter controls and URL-state synchronization.
2. Implement saved-view create/update/delete UX states.
3. Implement upload intake and ingestion-status state renderer.
4. Define no-result/invalid-filter and ingestion-failure UX behavior.

## Week 2
1. Validate query UX against latency and pagination behavior.
2. Validate ingestion retry/dead-letter status visibility and guidance.
3. Validate discoverability gate evidence packet with QA.
4. Publish unresolved risks and carry-over actions.

## DoR/DoD Gating
1. DoR: query API and ingestion status contracts are explicit.
2. DoR: saved view scoping rules are explicit.
3. DoD: search/filter/saved view UX is stable and predictable.
4. DoD: ingestion failures are visible and recoverable by UX flow.
5. DoD: docs and handoff notes are complete.
