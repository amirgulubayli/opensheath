# Sprint 01 Frontend Execution Pack

Sprint: `01`  
Theme: Foundation system build  
Primary epics: `F1-E1`, `F1-E2`  
Gate: CI/CD gate  
Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

## Sprint Objective
Implement frontend app-shell foundation that is contract-safe, CI-verifiable, and preview-deploy ready.

## Story Scope
1. `F1-E1-S1` Repository Structure and Tooling Baseline (frontend consumption lane)
2. `F1-E1-S2` Shared Contracts Package (frontend consumer alignment)
3. `F1-E1-S3` Architecture Guardrails (UI boundary compliance)
4. `F1-E2-S1` CI Quality Pipeline (frontend checks included)
5. `F1-E2-S2` Environment and Secrets Strategy (UI env contract awareness)
6. `F1-E2-S3` Preview Deployment Workflow (frontend preview validation)

## One-Day Task Breakdown

## Week 1
1. Define route skeleton and layout primitives contract list.
2. Define shared UI loading/error state contract.
3. Define frontend env-var contract and missing-env failure behavior.
4. Define CI-required frontend checks and evidence output format.

## Week 2
1. Validate preview behavior assumptions for UX-critical paths.
2. Validate architecture guardrail compliance expectations for UI modules.
3. Prepare CI/CD gate evidence packet for frontend lane.
4. Publish unresolved risks and carry-over recommendations.

## DoR/DoD Checkpoints
1. DoR: acceptance criteria mapped for all six Sprint `01` stories.
2. DoR: dependencies published before day `3`.
3. DoD: contract compatibility preserved (or versioned).
4. DoD: tests and CI checks documented as passing criteria.
5. DoD: observability and rollback notes included for risky changes.

## Current Blockers
1. Preview deployment automation still depends on DevOps lane integration details.
2. Remaining CI/CD gate closeout requires day-9 evidence packaging from QA/Release.
