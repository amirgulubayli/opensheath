# Sprint 10 Frontend Execution Pack

Sprint: `10`  
Theme: Entitlements, analytics, and security hardening  
Primary epics: `F7-E2`, `F7-E3`, `F8-E1`  
Gate: Beta readiness gate  
Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

## Sprint Objective
Deliver production-grade entitlement and analytics UX while hardening security-sensitive user interaction paths.

## Story Scope
1. `F7-E2-S1`, `F7-E2-S2`, `F7-E2-S3`
2. `F7-E3-S1`, `F7-E3-S2`, `F7-E3-S3`
3. `F8-E1-S1`, `F8-E1-S2`, `F8-E1-S3`

## Week-by-Week Execution

## Week 1
1. Implement plan-aware feature gating and quota boundary UX.
2. Implement upgrade and recovery guidance UX flows.
3. Implement analytics visibility surfaces and event-linked states.
4. Apply security hardening UX requirements for sensitive actions.

## Week 2
1. Validate entitlement enforcement behavior across plan tiers.
2. Validate analytics state reliability and event integrity assumptions.
3. Validate beta readiness evidence packet with QA/security/devops.
4. Publish unresolved risks and carry-over actions.

## DoR/DoD Gating
1. DoR: entitlement matrix and quota semantics are explicit.
2. DoR: analytics event taxonomy contracts are explicit.
3. DoD: gated features and upgrade/recovery UX are deterministic.
4. DoD: security-sensitive flows meet hardened behavior requirements.
5. DoD: docs and handoff notes are complete.
