# Sprint 07 Frontend Execution Pack

Sprint: `07`  
Theme: Retrieval quality and AI safety  
Primary epics: `F5-E2`, `F5-E3`, `F4-E3`  
Gate: AI quality gate  
Status: `READY`

## Sprint Objective
Deliver citation and evidence UX with confidence and safety signals that make AI outputs inspectable and trustworthy.

## Story Scope
1. `F5-E2-S1`, `F5-E2-S2`, `F5-E2-S3`
2. `F5-E3-S1`, `F5-E3-S2`, `F5-E3-S3`
3. `F4-E3-S1`, `F4-E3-S2`, `F4-E3-S3`

## Week-by-Week Execution

## Week 1
1. Implement citation rendering contract states.
2. Implement evidence panel and confidence cue surfaces.
3. Implement low-confidence and missing-evidence UX behavior.
4. Implement quality feedback controls and event capture hooks.

## Week 2
1. Validate retrieval-backed UI behavior and latency tolerance states.
2. Validate safety/refusal behavior UX for policy-triggered cases.
3. Validate AI quality gate evidence packet with QA/security/AI runtime.
4. Publish unresolved risks and carry-over actions.

## DoR/DoD Gating
1. DoR: citation payload and confidence contract are explicit.
2. DoR: moderation/refusal state contract is explicit.
3. DoD: citations and evidence panel are inspectable and stable.
4. DoD: safety/refusal UX behavior is deterministic.
5. DoD: quality feedback and observability hooks are documented.
