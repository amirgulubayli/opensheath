# Sprint 11 Frontend Execution Pack

Sprint: `11`  
Theme: Reliability, release, and GA rollout  
Primary epics: `F8-E2`, `F8-E3`  
Gate: GA launch gate  
Status: `READY`

## Sprint Objective
Finalize launch-grade UX reliability, controlled rollout behavior, and incident-safe communication states for GA.

## Story Scope
1. `F8-E2-S1`, `F8-E2-S2`, `F8-E2-S3`
2. `F8-E3-S1`, `F8-E3-S2`, `F8-E3-S3`

## Week-by-Week Execution

## Week 1
1. Implement performance/accessibility polish pass priorities.
2. Implement user-facing degradation and incident communication states.
3. Implement rollout-toggle and safe-disable UX behavior.
4. Validate migration/rollback user impact messaging plans.

## Week 2
1. Validate GA rollout UX behavior in staged traffic ramps.
2. Validate rollback and kill-switch user-safe paths.
3. Validate GA launch gate evidence packet with QA/release/security/devops.
4. Publish post-launch stabilization and carry-over actions.

## DoR/DoD Gating
1. DoR: rollout control and rollback contracts are explicit.
2. DoR: SLO/degradation signal mappings are explicit.
3. DoD: UX behavior under degradation and rollback is deterministic.
4. DoD: launch-critical flows satisfy performance/accessibility criteria.
5. DoD: docs and handoff notes are complete.
