## Frontend-Relevant Inputs Captured
1. Backend lane requests strict contract consumption and same-day gap reporting.
2. AI runtime lane requests early lock on:
   - structured response rendering states,
   - failure/escalation UI states,
   - citation/evidence contract rendering.
3. Data platform lane requests day `3` declaration for UI-impacting data expectations and day `9` evidence links.
4. DevOps/SRE lane requests day `3` environment-variable and feature-flag dependency list for rollout planning.

## Action Queue for Frontend
1. Publish per-sprint UI contract dependency checklist by day `3`.
2. Add schema drift check step to interface review before freeze.
3. Prepare day `9` gate evidence bundle format:
   - acceptance criteria mapping,
   - test summary,
   - observability note,
   - rollback/feature-flag note.
4. Keep AI and retrieval UI contracts versioned from Sprint `06` onward.
